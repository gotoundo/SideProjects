This model consists of several parts allowing you to animate it.
For proper rotation of each part, adjust the angle only around specific axis. 
To know which axis corresponds to which part of the model, read below.


Rotation axes:

TurretYawNode - Z-axis
TurretPitchNode - X-axis (consider 90 degrees Z-axis fix)
TurretBarrel - X-axis

(Only listed parts are supposed to be animated!)
